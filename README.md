### About

Hello! My name is Alfredo and I am a professional with 10 years of experience in IT and 2 years focused on programming. During my career, I have had the opportunity to work with some of the leading companies in the sector and develop valuable skills in programming, data extraction, and visualization. I am currently interested in connecting with professionals in my field to exchange ideas and learn from their experiences.
