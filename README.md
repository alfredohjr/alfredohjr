### Hello!!! ðŸ‘‹

### About

As a software engineer, I have applied my MBA in artificial intelligence and data science, achieving a 60% reduction in data processing time following the implementation of an optimization application, resulting in increased operational efficiency. Over 16 years, I demonstrated leadership in a collaboration initiative that led to a 40% reduction in response times to operational issues, significantly enhancing overall team effectiveness.

Some of the projects I have contributed to include the successful development of the stock rupture control application, resulting in a 20% decrease in instances of stock shortages and optimizing sales operations. I leverage Django REST Framework, relational databases, and SQL as my primary tools. Additionally, we utilize Django as an intranet platform for sharing routines and information within the organization, leading to a 40% improvement in internal communication efficiency. This integrated approach enhances collaboration and facilitates seamless information exchange among teams, contributing to a more efficient and cohesive workflow. I am genuinely passionate about NodeJS and web development, actively seeking opportunities to contribute to projects and stay abreast of the latest advancements in the field.
